User stories
============

Data Dump
---------
Enter data quickly.

User starts program and starts typing.  <CR> adds new child to current
parent, <TAB> reparents current node to current peer, <S-TAB> reparents
current node to current grandparent, next to current parent.  User should
be able to type as easily as when typing into a text editor. Data is saved
as it's edited.

This can also be accomplished by pasting equivalent plain text from the
clipboard.

Notes:
- by default the entry being edited is in edit mode (has focus, carat is
blinking, etc)
- clicking escape leaves edit mode, enters command mode

Tag Items
---------
Mark entries for organization.
