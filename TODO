User stories
============

Data Dump
---------
Enter data quickly.

User starts program and starts typing.  <CR> adds new child to current
parent, <TAB> reparents current node to current peer, <S-TAB> reparents
current node to current grandparent, next to current parent.  User should
be able to type as easily as when typing into a text editor. Data is saved
as it's edited.

This can also be accomplished by pasting equivalent plain text from the
clipboard.

Tag Items
---------
Mark entries for organization.

With a node selected user types <C-T> and a text box is displayed next
to the item, into which the user can enter a tag.

Filter View
-----------
Limit view to tagged items.

The user types <C-F>, and a text box is displayed at the bottom of the
screen, as the user types, if a tag is matched, then the display is
(quickly) limited to items tagged with the matching tags. If a tag isn't
matched, the view is filtered by all the matching tags.

Edit While Filtered
-------------------
While a view is filtered, all items added are automatically tagged with the
current tags so as to keep them in view.
